        "cons": "- WLB is not good because we have monthly event(s) and so we will need to do \"loadtest\" around 2-5 times. The loadtest will be done after midnight and will finish around 2-5 am. You will get 0.5-1 day dispense leave but still, you still have your task in sprint and destroying your sleep schedule is really bad.\r\n- Each event, the request per second (RPS) target is really arbitrarily. The management was really afraid or traumatized by the first failure that happen around 2019. As example:\r\nLet's say our (Business as usual) BAU RPS is around 2k and for the event the target becomes 12k. Even though the real RPS when the event is 4-5k. Then suddenly we have this \"exciting\" event and upper management suddenly says let's double our rps target and it becomes 24k. We have already done this for almost 2 years now and the actual RPS target was not even going more than 3 times the BAU RPS.\r\n- The way we create features already changed, previously we developed features for users but now it's for the \"numbers\" in business metrics.\r\n- Salary is below the average of other unicorns.\r\n- The politic after the Lead level is really toxic, everyone here just cares about themselves. There are some exceptions but it's really rare. Everyone trying to get a promotion, it's rare to see managers that trying to help their team to grow. \r\n- There are a lot of useless meetings, the content basically explains issues/something to your higher higher ups. Let's say A is your manager, B is A manager, and C is B manager. There will be meetings to explain to B and C. The communication is not efficient. \r\n- Some managers just care about what the upper management wants, not protecting the team from unreasonable requests.\r\n- Access requests can be a bottleneck because of the team that can grant the access to busy and overwhelmed by the total of requests.\r\n- If you get a bad manager, just prepare to resign otherwise you will be burnout. The bad managers don't really care about their teams.\r\n- Promotion Driven Development, \"if it's not giving me a good point for Performance Appraisal then I don't really care\" Attitude.\r\n- Information flow from upper management never goes to everyone, just several people. Like some new features or changes that can impact our workload, you can suddenly be told \"hey we have this new feature/event tomorrow, can you help us do this.\r\n- Some people are sweet talkers because of the promotion thingy (Exposure &gt; actual work).\r\n- Individual Contributor that can't really perform can just change to managerial, it's really stupid if you think about it. It's great if they can perform as managers but the reality is not like that. They are the kind of people that the team will become much better without them.\r\n- Can pay billion rupiah for events but refuse to increase salary increment even though it's already below market standard. For reference, several engineers that left to another company (not even go to Gojek/Traveloka/Bukalapak) get salary increase around 30-60%.",
